### **"Unlike Adobe" Page (Marketing Gold)**

```markdown
# Why We're Not Adobe (And Proud of It)

## Adobe Says:
"$69.99 per month, forever"
"Stop paying, lose access to your tools"
"We'll increase prices whenever we want"

## We Say:
"$99 once, own forever"
"Your tools, your ownership, your terms"
"We'll keep it affordable, always"

## Adobe Does:
❌ Forces subscriptions
❌ No free tier (just 7-day trial)
❌ Locks you into ecosystem
❌ Raises prices regularly ($20/mo → $70/mo over 10 years)
❌ Complicated pricing (12 plans, hidden fees)

## We Do:
✅ Offers excellent free tier
✅ One-time Studio purchase option
✅ Universal exports (take your work anywhere)
✅ Transparent pricing (forever)
✅ Simple: Free, Studio ($99), or AI ($9.99/mo)

## Our Promise:
We're building GenAI Galaxy Animate to free creators from subscription slavery.
We believe you should OWN your tools, not rent them.
We believe animation should be accessible to everyone.
We believe in the DaVinci Resolve model: excellent free, optional paid.

**Join the revolution. Break free from Adobe.**
```

Ready to build the Adobe killer? 🔥

User: We need to revise the pricing strategy. it doesn't make sense.
I think we need a 4 pricing system.

tier 1: free tier = limited access, the hook. But a creator should be able to do a lot with the free tier. (no watermarks on any tier, all creators own right to their own creations)
tier 2: (???) = Access to better tools, better export features, etc.
tier 3: (Pro Edition) = Access to both tier 1 and tier 2, and early access to new fetures, and limited access to ai tools with an option to purchase ai credits, or API import your own Ai's if you have a strong enough system for it.
tier 4 (Ultra Edition) Access to all three tiers, plus access to better ai tool use... and more features we need to come up with.

GitHub Copilot: ## 🎯 **REVISED PRICING STRATEGY: 4-Tier System**

---

## 💎 **Pricing Philosophy**

1. **No watermarks at ANY tier** - Respect creators
2. **Creators own all their work** - Full commercial rights from Free tier up
3. **Free tier is genuinely powerful** - Not a crippled trial
4. **Clear value progression** - Each tier unlocks meaningful capabilities
5. **One-time purchase OR subscription** - User's choice
6. **AI is tiered credits** - Pay for compute, not held hostage
