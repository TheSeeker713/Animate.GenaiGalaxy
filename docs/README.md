## 📦 Archived Plans

The following documents have been superseded by the consolidated Master Plan:

- `plans.md` through `plans10.md` (moved to `archive/` folder)
- These contained ~7,000 lines with significant redundancy
- Consolidated into 2 focused documents (~2,000 lines total)

**Why Consolidate?**
- ✅ Eliminated 60%+ redundancy (especially pricing discussions)
- ✅ Removed outdated material (generic animation library concept)
- ✅ Created single source of truth
- ✅ Easier to maintain & update
- ✅ Clearer for team members to understand direction

---

## 🗺️ What Changed in Consolidation

### Removed/Updated:
1. **plans.md** - Completely outdated generic animation library plan (not relevant)
2. **Pricing redundancy** - 3 documents discussed same 4-tier pricing with minor variations
3. **Technical overlap** - Implementation details scattered across 4 documents
4. **Evolution artifacts** - Pricing went 2-tier → 3-tier → 4-tier across docs

### Consolidated Into:
1. **Mission & Philosophy** - Unified from plans6, plans7, plans8
2. **4-Tier Pricing** - Final version from plans9/plans10
3. **Technical Architecture** - Merged from plans4/plans5/plans6
4. **Revenue Model** - Best projections from plans8/plans9
5. **Implementation Phases** - Organized timeline from all technical plans

## 🎯 Quick Reference

**For Business Context:**  
→ Read [MASTER_PLAN.md](./MASTER_PLAN.md)

**For Development:**  
→ Read [TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](./TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md)

**For Historical Context:**  
→ See `archive/` folder (original 10 plan documents)

## 📝 How to Update

When adding new features or changing direction:

1. **Update [MASTER_PLAN.md](./MASTER_PLAN.md)** for:
   - Business model changes
   - New feature specifications
   - Pricing adjustments
   - Mission/philosophy updates

2. **Update [TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md](./TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md)** for:
   - Implementation details
   - Code examples
   - Timeline adjustments
   - Technical specifications

**Do NOT create new numbered plan files** - Keep these two documents as single source of truth.
